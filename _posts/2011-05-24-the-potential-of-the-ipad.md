Ever since the iPad came out in 2010, I never failed to doubt its, and more importantly, its apps' impact on learning and productivity in general. When it was first announced, I knew it was going to be a game-changer in the portable computing area. In fact, I find that, if I weren't a developer, I think I can probably junk my mac and survive with just the iPad.

Of course, it's not only about learning, productivity, and business. Clearly, it can do so much more, especially when it comes to entertainment, games, music, etc. But I won't be surprised if, someday, enterprises would actually just use iPads for their daily operations.

The experience it's able to provide and its price-point compared to traditional workstations is something to really watch out and prepare for, and the already mature App Store ecosystem will make that a reality sooner than later.
