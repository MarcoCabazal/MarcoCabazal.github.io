Through the years, I've accumulated a good amount of books about photography, design, typography, business, legal, and, of course, several technical books. I've also had some Mario Puzo and Star Trek novels, maps, travel guides and other stuff. As you can see my taste in reading material is quite varied.

I've read them at least once and there are some that I'd pick up and browse through over and over. There are a couple which I've never finished and at least one that I've never even attempted to read.

I've had these books in a book case which I've tried to keep neat and dust-free. I liked looking at this book case because, somehow, it's like a shrine to my journey to who I am now. It reminded me of who I was, what I've learned, and how I evolved as a person.

I loved how my friends reacted to what they saw in this book case. Some were amused. Some appreciated me more. Some got disappointed. It would be the most interesting piece of furniture that I owned, next to my mattress, of course.

With beer in hand, I'd look at it as a trophy case and smile, and relish all the memories. But lately, I started asking myself what the point really is.. what the point is in having all these books that nobody else is reading anymore.

It's when I realized that these books have got to go. I've benefitted a lot from them but they must now be passed on, because books that are not in the hands of whom needs them most are useless books.
